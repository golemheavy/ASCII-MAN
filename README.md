# ASCII-man

This is a version of the classical hangman game. The player attempts to guess the hidden word before his available guesses "expire." (Apologies for the "gallows humor.")

To use, run: `npm install`. After this, run `npm run ts`. Then view the page in a browser.

Future versions should support mobile text input. Also possible future enhancements include multiplayer, collaborative or competitive.
