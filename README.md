# ASCII-man

This is a version of the classical hangman game. The player attempts to guess the hidden word before his available guesses "expire." (Apologies for the "gallows humor.")

To use, run: `npm install`. After this, you can optionally run `npm run ts` to create the game.js file from the game.ts file. However, this is not necessary because the game.js file is already included in this repo.

To play, type `npm run serve` and visit the URL shown in a browser.

Future versions should support mobile text input. Also possible future enhancements include multiplayer, collaborative or competitive.
